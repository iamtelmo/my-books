# MyBooks

Welcome to My books! My books was an attempt in my initial days in web development to attend into Bending Spoon's First Ascent event. I was starting my path into web development and I wanted to learn oauth concepts and api endpoints creation and usage, so I did this project. 

It is a simple website where you can save books you most like into your library, and be able to share it with others.
